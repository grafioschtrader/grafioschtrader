<!-- This is the main configuration file for the server side Spring setup, 
	which mostly is about configuring SpringMVC. We use annotation based configuration 
	however so this file is really quite simple. If you want to add database 
	or security support via Spring (which I'd highly recommend) then you can 
	do so in this file. In the client we are able to avoid the XML configuration 
	file using the @Configuration annotation on a factory class. Currently on 
	the server this won't cut it, so we need to have this minimal XML file. The 
	next version of Spring looks to include a way to avoid this. -->
