Enter the ISIN if the instrument is traded in Frankfurt or Xetra.
The <a target="_blank" href="//www.boerse-frankfurt.de/">BÃ¶rse Frankfurt</a> or Xetra also provides information on instruments that are not traded there. For example the <a target="_blank" href="//www.boerse-frankfurt.de/index/nasdaq-100">NASDAQ 100</a> uses Frankfurt ARIVA as data supplier. This can be seen via the network of the developer tools when clicking on the chart analysis: "https://api.boerse-frankfurt.de/v1/tradingview/history?symbol=ARIVA:US6311011026&...". For such instrument the supplier is entered with the ISIN, for example "ARIVA:US6311011026".</br> 
It should be noted that ARIVA offers the historical data only about 10 years back.
