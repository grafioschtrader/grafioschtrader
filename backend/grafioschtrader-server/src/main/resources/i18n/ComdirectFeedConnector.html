Often the instrument must reselected again via the "Trefferliste" to get a cleaned URL, i.e. without "SEARCH_REDIRECT" etc.<br>
Then take the part after "...inf/" from the URL.
For example, "shares/volkswagen-share-DE0007664039" is taken from "https://www.comdirect.de/inf/aktien/volkswagen-aktie-DE0007664039".
