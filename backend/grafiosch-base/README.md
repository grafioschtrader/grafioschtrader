## Why this module
This artifact is definitely part of the backend. However, it could also be used as part of a Java frontend. No additional classes and interfaces would have to be created in the frontend for communication between the backend and frontend.

## Advantages of Using Entities as Transfer Objects in a Spring Boot REST Project
Using entities directly as transfer objects in a REST API can provide several benefits. Below are some key advantages:

### Reduced Code Duplication
- **Single Definition:** Entities serve dual purposes for both persistence and data transfer, eliminating the need for separate DTOs.
- **Lean Codebase:** With fewer classes to maintain, the overall code is simpler and more maintainable.

### Faster Development Cycles
- **No Mapping Overhead:**: By using entities directly, you avoid the additional mapping steps between the persistence model and DTOs.
- **Rapid Iteration:** Changes to the domain model can be implemented and propagated quickly, facilitating fast development cycles.

### Consistency Between Backend and Frontend
- **Unified Annotations:** Annotations on entity fields (e.g., for validation or GUI metadata) can be utilized by both the backend and frontend. This ensures:
  - **Consistent Validation:** Validation rules are uniformly applied on both server and client sides.
  - **Automatic GUI Generation:** Frontend components can leverage metadata to dynamically build interfaces.

### Automated Documentation
- **Seamless Integration:** Tools such as Swagger can extract annotations from entities to automatically generate and update API documentation.
- **Up-to-Date References:** The documentation stays in sync with the codebase, reducing the risk of discrepancies.

### Simplified Maintenance
- **Centralized Updates:** Changes to business objects are made in one place, minimizing the risk of errors across multiple layers.
- **Reduced Complexity:** Maintaining a single source for both persistence and transfer logic simplifies ongoing development and debugging.

### Direct Utilization of Validation Rules
- **Annotation-Based Validation:** Frameworks like Hibernate Validator allow you to declare validation rules directly on the entity fields.  
- **Enhanced Data Integrity:** These rules can be used on both server and client sides, ensuring that data integrity is enforced from the very beginning.
