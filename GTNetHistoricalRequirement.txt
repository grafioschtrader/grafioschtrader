The workflow for exchanging the latest prices and historical price data in GTNet should not differ fundamentally. Without describing this in detail, in the case of historical data, the AC_PUSH_OPEN server should also be consulted first, followed by the AC_OPEN server. The difference is that the query also contains the date with the most recent price data + 1 day. If the supplier cannot provide prices for a particular instrument, its response should be approximately as follows for a security: ISIN, CURRENCY, date (most recent historical price data + 1); for a currency pair, a different key value is used. The AC_OPEN server will only respond in this way if it itself wants to receive the historical prices for this instrument. The AC_PUSH_OPEN server is, of course, always interested in newer historical price data if it does not already have it. As with the “last price” workflow, the suppliers called should also receive the newer historical prices from consumers in the further steps of this workflow. The consumer's update to its suppliers with historical price data will of course differ due to the previously received date. Certain methods can probably be shared between the existing GTNetLastpriceService and HistoryquoteExchangeMsg.  For example, getSuppliersByPriorityWithRandomization.
