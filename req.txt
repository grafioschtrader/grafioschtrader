We are introducing a new property, “gt.gtnet.del.message.recv.lp.” This can be set to two values between 1 and 10 days. Based on this setting, GT_NET_LASTPRICE_EXCHANGE_SEL_C and GT_NET_LASTPRICE_EXCHANGE_RESPONSE_S are deleted in GTNetMessage. The value is the current date and time minus the number of days that GT_NET_LASTPRICE_EXCHANGE_SEL_C will be retained and therefore not deleted. The same applies to GT_NET_LASTPRICE_EXCHANGE_RESPONSE_S and GT_NET_HISTORYQUOTE_EXCHANGE_RESPONSE_S. The value can be propertyString, which would look as follows. “LP=1,HP=5”. Global parameters can be given an input rule for validation. In GTNetExchangeLogAggregationTask, there are values such as “gt.gtnet.log.aggregate.daily.after” that can be set via application.properties. These should be implemented with global parameter properties. The format of propertyString here would be, for example, “D=1,W=7,M=30,Y=365”. In addition, this background job should now also delete the above-mentioned GT_NET_LASTPRICE_EXCHANGE_SEL_C, etc. The task and the corresponding NLS texts may need to be changed.
