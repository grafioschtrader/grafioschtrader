TimeSeriesChartComponent currently only has a line chart. How about support for candlestick and OHLC charts? However, this would only be possible if the corresponding historical price data allows it. Many securities do not have OHLC data, only the closing price. The rest request tenantsecurity/...?forchart=true would probably also have to return whether the OHLC data is available. I would determine whether OHLC data is available for an instrument from two history quote data sets. This would be the most recent and the oldest Daum. Please note that currently, the member high, etc. are also assigned values, but with 0. This means that 0 and NULL are currently equivalent in historyquote. The conversion of the different chart types should be done via a p-select. This input is only active if OHLC data is also available for the instrument. However, if a candlestick chart or OHLC chart is selected for the current chart and a new instrument is selected for the chart and this also has OHLC data, there should be no fallback to the line chart. The line chart is the default chart and is also switched to if several instruments are displayed in the chart. For instruments that do not have OHLC data, this extension should only provide the date with the corresponding close. Otherwise, the REST response would contain too much unnecessary data.
