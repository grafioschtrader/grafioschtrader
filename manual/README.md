## Manual
GT's help is linked to static web pages via web links. The content of these pages has been generated by the static website generator [HUGO](//gohugo.io/) and the theme [learn](//themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-learn/). At the moment the manual is hosted by [GitHub](https://hugograf.github.io/grafioschtrader) and there is no need for deployment.
