GTNetSupplierDetail determines which instruments (currency pairs, securities) are included in a query. The content of GTNetSupplierDetail is determined from GTNetExchange and the query to the supplier. A job (ITask) is certainly needed to update GTNetSupplierDetail. In addition, an enum must be created in GTNetMessageCodeType and a corresponding handler must be implemented. If this query takes place between two AC_OPEN servers, GTNetSupplierDetail will receive an update from both the sender and the recipient. When a request is made to the AC_PUSH_OPEN server, the availability of prices is determined via “GTNetLastPrice*”. An update of GTNetSupplierDetail is necessary as soon as GTNetExchange changes. It is best if this job is created as soon as the user closes the front end of GTNetExchangeBaseComponent and has also made changes to GTNetExchange while there, i.e., one or more saves. The request to the supplier should only take place with the changed GTNetExchange object. There is a global parameter “gt.gtnet.exchange.timestamp” in the database. The implementation in GlobalParametersService is still missing. Based on this property in GlobalParameters and lastModifiedTime, it can be determined which GTNetExchange objects need to be sent to the supplier. When this job is completed, the property with the timestamp must of course be updated.Otherwise, the comparison of the timestamps in GTNetExchange and this property in Globalparameters will not be successful.
