Certain messages in GTNet are future-oriented and therefore announcements. For example, MaintenanceMsg and others have a date in the future. When sending such a message, not all recipients who have successfully performed a handshake with us may be online. For this reason, the GTNetMessageAttempt entity was created. This previously unused entity will probably need to be significantly reworked. It should record who has received or not received the above-mentioned type of message. Messages in this category should always be sent in the background (ITask). In addition, the sending of such messages should be repeated periodically. When we complete a successful handshake with a new remote server, it should of course also receive these messages. GTNetMessageAttempt will probably have to be built in such a way that it certainly has a member idGtNet (target instance), idGtNetMessage (message), and hasSend (boolean). The background job should not send messages whose effect lies in the past. It should also clean itself up. To avoid a second entity alongside GTNetMessageAttempt, the sending instance could also receive an entry as the source. One scenario would be that all existing remote instances have received such a message. Nevertheless, GTNetMessageAttempt can only be cleaned up when the date or dates are in the past. I believe this can be achieved with my background job. I see this job running every 5 hours and otherwise being executed immediately after such a message is sent.
